# Projet CS IA : grrrrrrr

## Requirements
Python 3.6+ must be installed. 
We assume it can be accessed by `python` command, 
but on linux distribution, it is more likely to be
`python3`.

To install package requirements, run the following command lines:
```
cd vampires_vs_direwolves
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to run grrrrrrr with its terrible AI Boutchou ?
```
cd vampires_vs_direwolves
python main.py [HOST_IP] [PORT]
```

If host ip and port are not specified, default values in 
`server_connection/config_connection.py` are used.
